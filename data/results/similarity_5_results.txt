Internships for high school students?
Global leadership adventures for university students?
Our planet will face huge challenges during your lifetime. Some of these challenges have already begun to surface.
Plastic in the ocean, for example. Every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans. It’s estimated that there may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean, with a combined weight of 269,000 tonnes. Plastic pollution is responsible for the deaths of 100,000 marine mammals and turtles and one million seabirds every year.
Climate change. The planet’s average land temperature has risen by nearly 1°C in the past 50 years as a result of human activity, and global greenhouse gas emissions have grown by nearly 80% since 1970. Have you noticed that storms have become more frequent, and more intense? That drought is becoming more prevalent worldwide? We’re already seeing and feeling the impacts of climate change.
Poverty. Over three billion people – that’s almost half the world – live on less than $2.50 a day, and at least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. Statistics from Unicef show that 22,000 children die each day due to poverty, in some of the poorest villages on earth.
Gender equality. For the past decade, the World Economic Forum has been measuring the pace of change through the Global Gender Gap Report. While we’re getting closer to achieving gender equality, at current rates, it would take the world another 115 years – or until 2133 – to close the economic gap entirely.
That’s just four of the biggest problems the world is facing right now – and there’s a whole lot more where that came from. But the good news is, we’re on a mission to reverse these problems – and make the world a better place in the process.
We believe that global problems demand new and powerful forms of leadership. Therefore, we want to unite young people around the world’s most pressing problems and empower them to become driven and visionary leaders through extraordinary experiences.
Our 7-14+ day volunteer abroad programs put students at the heart of these communities and give them the chance to learn about global issues by working to solve them.
Plastic in the ocean, for example. Like the idea of volunteering with animals and being part of the transition to a plastic-free world? You’ll participate in beach clean-ups and contribute to the conservation and protection of marine species on our sea turtle internship in Costa Rica.
Poverty. We place you in disadvantaged communities where you’re most needed, and where you’ll make the biggest difference. We send you to schools lacking teachers and resources. To hospitals and clinics which are ruthlessly understaffed. To orphanage populated by pupils whose parents can’t afford to keep them at home. Whether you step into the shoes of a hospital volunteer or you choose to volunteer with children, you’ll be making a huge difference in the lives of many.
Gender equality. We’re really proud of our women empowerment programs across Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America. These volunteer projects abroad focus on training women in life and income-generating skills to encourage financial independence and ultimately fight poverty.
And there’s more where that came from. Species extinction? We’re on it (check out our sloth conservation program.) Combating loneliness? We place volunteers in Elderly Care Centers across the globe. Preventing the spread of HIV? We have HIV awareness programs that are helping to manage the virus in local communities. And other 245 social and conservation programs.
We want to help you understand the world and its problems. Our goal is to give you the confidence and the tools to be a leader and generate a ripple of change in the world, by taking you to global communities where you can see the effects first-hand, and work alongside locals to create positive change.
We work closely with schools to design a bespoke itinerary and trip curriculum that meets each establishment’s individual needs and objectives.
We require that at least one faculty member or parent participates in the trip alongside the students (one per 10 students). In fact, one teacher gets a discount for every group of 10 paying students! Why? In addition to ensuring students stay safe on our trips, we also want educators as involved as possible in order to impact the larger school community and ensure the learning continues after the trip has ended.

As well as tackling global issues head on, outdoor adventure and cultural explorations also form an important part of these volunteer opportunities. Options include: trekking in the Andean highlands of Peru or Nepal, snorkeling in Honduras or Chile, visiting Machu Picchu in Peru or going on safari in Tanzania or Uganda.
Our service project ideas extend past high school and college. We have also partnered with universities not just across the US, but across the world, to create volunteer leadership programs across sectors including health, HIV awareness, teaching abroad, orphanage support, building and restoration, vocational training, animal welfare and ecology, sea turtle conservation and so much more.
We have partnerships with universities in the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Australia and many more. Please click here to see whether A Broader View works in partnership with your university.
As a 5***** trusted volunteer organization that’s been up and running for over 11 years, we’re super familiar with hosting group tours. We’ve hosted student-led alternative spring trips, faculty-led service learning trips, medical and dental brigades, corporate retreat programs, family volunteer vacations, and high school language & cultural immersion tours.
With this in mind, please rest assured that safety is our number one priority. For all the parents and teachers reading this: we have a 100% safety record.We’ve build safety into every level of our trips, including highly experienced in-country directors and the communities themselves, which are small and close-knit. Our host families take the safety of our students very seriously, and we can also offer hostels or hotels as alternative accommodation.

Text: Educational travel is an opportunity for teachers and community leaders to use the world as their classroom. As group leaders, educators lead their students abroad on tours that range in duration from a few days to several weeks. During that time, students can experience many of the things they have read about in textbooks or learned to say in language classes, placing classroom lessons into a real world context.
Who travels on an educational tour?
Typically, educational tours are led by teachers who want to engage their students by taking learning outside the classroom. Group leaders are often high school teachers who teach foreign languages, social studies, art, English and science courses. But anyone who wants to enrich young people’s lives can lead such a tour. Student travelers are typically in high school but can also be in middle school or college. Anyone who wants to learn about the world by experiencing it firsthand can find a place on an educational tour.
What are the benefits for teachers who take students on a tour?
For teachers, the biggest benefit is that they are changing their students’ lives. Many teachers credit their experiences on tour with making them better teachers, and travel can benefit schools as a whole as well. Students who travel often return more confident with a new understanding of the world around them, and their experiences help promote cultural understanding among students and teachers.
What are the benefits for students who go on a tour?
In addition to the life-changing benefits of seeing the world, students who travel on an educational tour can earn credit by completing coursework associated with some of the tours. As more and more colleges expect students to have had international experiences, educational travel enhances students’ college applications and prepares them for a more international higher education experience. Many students have also credited traveling on an educational tour with inspiring them to study abroad and even influencing their career direction.
Rome: Pizza-making – students learn how to make a classic Italian favorite from expert chefs!
Madrid: Flamenco or Fado lessons – students learn the age-old art of the Fado song or the rhythmic steps of flamenco.
London: Globe Theatre Workshop – students practice the dramatic art by reciting the works of Shakespeare and learning about stagecraft.
China: Cultural immersion – students get a glimpse of Chinese culture by visiting a local family for dinner, visiting a school and learning about traditional and modern Chinese medicine with a visit to a local hospital.
Africa: Young Rangers activities – students partake in hands-on activities designed to give them a feel for what life is like in the wilderness.

Things are sure busy at Covenant Christian School this term. You will no doubt have noticed by now that we are in the busyness of a building development, something we are very grateful to God for. The new C Block will be a wonderful addition to the resources of our school, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead.
Besides the obvious, it is now week three of the HSC examinations, and a number of our students are now finished their final examinations, and many getting close to the end. We would appreciate your ongoing prayers for our students as they seek to communicate their understanding in their exams at this time, as they approach the last day of testing on November 7. But much more than that, our prayer is that the students, who complete Year 12 and move onto other things, will remember the things they were taught at school, and find their identity in Christ Jesus.
On Monday, I was one of the parents picking up children after the Musical rehearsals, feeling thankful for the time our staff and students are putting into their preparations for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which is only a few short weeks away. As you continue to pray, please remember our staff in particular, who on top of their enormous marking and reporting load, are giving up many hours to ensure that the show is a great success! Don’t forget to buy your tickets, and I look forward to seeing you there!
As we come to the end of another year, it provides an opportunity to reflect on the things God has taught us, and the privilege it is to serve Him here at Covenant. For me, this year has been a year when I have learned much about trust. Trust in God and His sovereignty in all things. A reminder that He is in control and I am not. That His ways are higher than our ways, and that He is worthy of our trust. To God be the glory.

This year, Covenant again hosted the annual Pushing the Boundaries Extension and Enrichment Day for Year 9 students. The day was a buzz of energy, creativity and academic fervour as 225 students from schools all around the state came together for a day of exciting workshops. There were nine morning workshops and nine afternoon workshops for students to consider. Topics were many and varied, from UNSW Engineering, to Philosophy to Digital Music and Psychology. The Australian Theatre for Young People hosted a Physical Theatre and Stage Fighting workshop for those who were dramatically inclined and the University of New South Wales hosted a coding workshop for those eager to develop their computing skills.
It was fantastic to see students pushed creatively and academically with like-minded peers. Many were excited to experience subjects, which aren’t normally addressed in the regular curriculum. One highlight was seeing so many students from so many different schools come together and form new friendships.
All in all, an exciting day!
Year 9 IST visited Telstra and Apple in the city. At Telstra they spent time looking at the technology that Telstra use to both communicate and support their customer requirements. They looked at how technology is now being used in the home and also in the store. They saw how sensors are used to track popular products in store by looking at the location of people in the store and how prices on products are now updated digitally rather than printing new prices for stock.
Students then went to Apple and looked into the history of Apple products up to the future. They focused on Augmented Reality and spent time learning to code using the new Swift application.
At the beginning of the last holidays, I was lucky enough to be awarded a scholarship to attend SCIVIS which is Space Camp for visually impaired students held in the US Space and Rocket Center in Alabama USA. I was just old enough to participate in the Advanced Space Academy which was pretty awesome.
At the beginning of the last holidays, I was lucky enough to be awarded a scholarship to attend SCIVIS which is Space Camp for visually impaired students held at the US Space and Rocket Center in Alabama USA. I was just old enough to participate in the Advanced Space Academy which was pretty awesome.
I flew over with two students and two chaperones from the RIDBC (the people who support me at school). We were even allowed to sit in the cockpit once we had landed (which is really unusual nowadays with all the security stuff). We went a few days early so that we could get over the jetlag because you do not want to be tired at space camp as every day was from 7am-11pm.
The camp facilities themselves are really cool. The dorms are replicas of shuttles and rockets and are designed to look like a futuristic space station. There are also various shuttles, rockets and military vehicles all around the camp.
We were all put into teams of about 12 people and we stayed with our team for all 6 days of camp. As part of a team you do a lot of things together: eat meals, hang out, do missions and lots of physical and team building exercises to build up trust and believe me, you definitely want to trust your team at space camp, especially when you are relying on your team to not crash your shuttle when you are entering Earth’s atmosphere.
We also completed many different space simulated missions. I was appointed shuttle commander on our final mission to Mars. Throughout the mission I had to fill out a checklist of things to do like pressing buttons, flicking switches and doing a lot of calculations so that you don’t aim your shuttle in the wrong direction. We had to fix malfunctions of the shuttle when a light from a panel of lights would turn on saying there was an “Oxygen deficiency” or “Rocket thrusters go offline” and things like that. These missions and situations really help you to think on your feet and handle stress quite well.
We also had people from NASA come in and talk to us about their jobs, some of whom were visually impaired and they were doing really high-level jobs at NASA like engineering. Their stories were really encouraging for us because it showed us that nothing can stop us from pursuing our passion.
The Physical Challenges are really full on, with the hardest one probably being the one where we have to climb to the top of a 35ft telegraph pole, stand on the top for a few seconds, and then jump off.
At space camp, we were given a lot of different simulations to give the feeling of lack of gravity. We even went scuba diving (in a tank so no sharks!) which was really fun. We also went on a device called the 1:6 chair which holds 5/6 of your weight and gives you the experience of being super light.
We also went on something called the multi-access trainer which spins you around and gives you the feeling of what it would be like if your shuttle was hit in space. Luckily, nobody threw up! We also took part in engineering challenges where we were given a small amount of time and fake money to design things like rockets (which we launched at the end of camp) and Mars land rovers. We also attended a lot of different seminars based on astronomy and history.
Space Camp is open all year but once a year it is open to visually impaired students only. All the instruction and information is in Braille or large print so that everyone can participate. It was great to meet so many different people from around the world and see what their lives were like, and how they face their own challenges in life (I also had people believing 'drop bears' are real and Australia doesn’t have SpongeBob).
I am so thankful for the opportunity to have attended Space Camp. I was sponsored by Northrup Grumman (which is a company who creates parts for the Shuttles and Rockets for NASA) and the RIDBC who sent over chaperones to take photos of our course. Space Camp was an unforgettable experience and something that I would recommend to anyone.
Last week at Extend After School Care we were very creative. We made origami crabs and chatter boxes. On Tuesday we had a picnic and did running races from one side of the high school oval to the other. I think it was a very active week!

Many young people want to work with animals, but don’t know where to start looking. They also often feel like veterinary science is out of their reach. Here are a few websites and ideas to start researching jobs with animals.
(Even though this an American website it has some good ideas and a good place to start thinking about potential jobs with animals. Note the pay scale would be different in Australia).
Find out about mechatronic engineering. It is documented that around forty-four per cent of jobs are under threat from automation, according to CSIRO. And it’s not just manufacturing, even jobs like accounting and law are at risk. But the news is not all bad. Just as fast as robots are replacing jobs, new careers are being created and many of them are in robotics.

Drama Teacher, Mrs Pitt, would like to leave you with a joke - what has four wheels and flies? Scroll down.
Almost 40 years ago in 1978 on Saturday the 20th May, Dr Joel Nederhood, a radio Minister on the ‘Back to God Hour’, addressed the fundamental reason for why a group of parents set out to start Covenant Christian School.
Our society has, basically, two answers to this question.
There is the Marxist idea: children belong to the Government, they are part of the State. And so the State is in control of education. Children have to be taught that they grow up into the kind of persons the State wants them to become. Parents have no responsibility regarding education and should not do what the State has to do.
Then we have the individualistic approach: these children are MY children, they are my possession and I can do with them as I please. This approach can have terrible consequences. Let us think for an instance of abortion. The basic thing here is that when you have a child, even an unborn child, then it is up to you what to do with that child. It is said: "It is the right of then mother to make a choice whether her child will live or die". The future of the child is dependent exclusively on what the mother decides will happen to the child.
As Christians, we reject the notion that our children belong to the State. We also reject the notion that our children are the possession of the parents. As Christians we joyfully believe that our children are GOD's children. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul is speaking about women who married unbelievers and husbands who married unbelieving wives. He then says that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by her believing husband. Otherwise - he says - your children would be unclean, but no they are holy.
Paul makes here an important point. Even though the marriage is not an idea one - one of a believer and an unbeliever - yet the child of a believing parent is a holy child. That does not mean that these children are perfect, but it means that these children have been set aside (the word "holy" often means that), they have a special position: they belong to God, they belong to the Covenant.
What does the "Covenant" mean?
It means that when God works His grace in this world He does not say: I include this man, that woman, that child; but when He comes in His grace He says: I will be your God and the god of your children.
This does not mean our children are automatically saved because they are Covenant children. It means that before they know their right hand from their left, God comes into their lives with His message of Salvation. He sets His mark upon them and says: "this child belongs to Me!" That is the dynamic of the Covenant.
What a blessing it is to be brought up in the fear of the Lord. What kind of children are they? The children of believers!
What a wonderful and glorious privilege. We received our children from the hand of the Lord and we know that. Now it is our responsibility to bring up our children in the fear of the Lord.
I like to approach this matter of Christian education first from the negative side; the alternative.
Christian education is not just the icing on the cake - it is absolutely necessary, for the alternative is to bring them into a pagan temple! Let me show you what I mean by that. I don't want to day awful things about people. I know that there are wonderful people in the State schools and we thank God for teachers, principals and administrators in those schools who love the name of Jesus Christ. But I am talking about the State school as a system. Because education in the State school is pagan, the school itself is a pagan temple!
A nation confesses its faith when it educates the children. It is a totally religious affair. Decisions have to be made which are fully religious. A decision has to be made whether there is a God who made everything. When education deals with all the things around us a choice is to be made: did God create it all or it is all the result of evolution? The answer is most important, and one way or another it is a religious answer!
To mention another example: what exactly are the children, what is man? The State school says: man is part of the animal kingdom. That is a decision, a religious one! Or: what is the ultimate authority? Is it man's rationality or is it the Bible?
Education is religious and the school is a temple. It is a pagan temple dedicated to naturalistic evolution, or a temple of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Every day of every school period is a confession of faith When we talk about the world we say: "this is my Father's world." And we can't send our children to a place where the idols of this world are being worshiped all the time.
A Christian school is not a school where we teach church doctrine. That is the church's responsibility. But it is the task of the school to witness to the children about the saving love of Jesus Christ. We teach them to think in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is a tragedy of our time that so many children of Christian parents are sent to State schools. They may attend Sunday school, they may go to church and learn there to worship the LORD. And then they are sent to a school where they are taught to worship a secular idol.... State schools are fine schools for people who do not believe in Jesus. But there is no place in it for children who belong to God!
To faithfully serve in God’s plan to restore all things under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
To assist parents in the nurture of their children, by providing a Christ-centred, biblically grounded, culturally engaging and academically rigorous education to equip the children to live for God’s glory.

Is it moral to create a donor baby?
Is the mind a physical thing?
The evening involved students from a range of schools such as Ascham School, North Sydney Girls High School, Meriden School and Cranbrook School (among others). Students ventured avenues such as utilitarianism, Kant’s Categorical Imperative, the transcendental qualities of mind and art, the planes of interaction between the brain and the mind, the sacrificial nature of safety, totalitarianism, and the true nature of Being, in an attempt to answer these perplexing questions.
Overall, the night’s discussion was both fascinating and enriching for all students and spectators and it has hopefully encouraged students to consider with greater depth, issues or notions which may often be erroneously pawned off as being superfluous or pointless.
Year 8 went to Orchard Hills Water Recycling Plant and St Mary's Water Recycling Plant to see how water is managed in the greater Sydney area. Orchard Hills provides Sydney with all its drinking water and the students learnt how this process is managed. St Mary's treats all the waste water that is generated by removing all the dirty items imaginable that are flushed away and once the water is treated it is returned to the river system.
The students completed some scientific water testing to ensure our water meets drinking standard and learnt what we has humans can do to help manage this valuable resource.
​On Thursday 26 October, a team of 25 Secondary School students and seven Junior School students ventured to the International Regatta Centre, Penrith, to participate in triathlons and biathlons. For the majority of students, this was their first experience in participating in such an event.
Thank you to the awesome support crew of Mrs McDonald, Mr Cochrane and the many parents who helped on the day with transporting students and bikes. The triathlon team are very grateful to be given this opportunity to compete in these events.
Early one morning, 45 students loaded their instruments onto a coach ready for a day of music. Timpanis, Trumpets and Tenor Saxs were transported all the way to Newcastle where the Senior Band linked up with Music students from Belmont Christian College for a day of performances and workshops.
Belmont Christian College's Principal, Miss Sopher, was at Covenant for over 10 years before taking up her new role in 2016. The College have just started a new band program in their Junior School, so our students were able to provide them with some workshops and section tutoring, as well as presenting a concert that will hopefully inspire them in their desire to pursue their instrument further. A fun day was had by all!
Thanks Belmont for hosting us, and thanks to our teachers for letting us out of class for the day to make the most of this great opportunity.

Simona Abdallah plays Arabic percussion, primarily the Darbuka, a goblet-shaped drum. She has broken through traditional expectations to enjoy international success.
Simona Abdallah is lauded as the first female percussionist from an Arabic background. She plays the Darbouka, an instrument that is traditionally played by men. Her passion and talent drive her forwards to break barriers and escape oppressive surroundings. Her music combines traditional sounds with modern beats.
Abdallah identifies herself as Palestinian Danish. Her parents fled from to Lebanon to Germany, where she was born in 1979. The family subsequently moved to Denmark, where Abdallah spent her childhood in Denmark's second largest city, the windy port town of Aarhus.
Former Georgia House Democratic Leader Stacey Abrams made history in 2018 when she earned the Democratic nomination for governor of Georgia.
Stacey Abrams's 2018 campaign for governor of Georgia turned more voters than any Democrat in Georgia history, including former President Barack Obama, and invested in critical infrastructure to build progress in the state. After witnessing the gross mismanagement of the election by the Secretary of State's office, Abrams launched Fair Fight to ensure every Georgian has a voice in our election system.
Abrams received degrees from Spelman College, the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas and Yale Law School. Dedicated to civic engagement, she founded the New Georgia Project, which submitted more than 200,000 registrations from voters of color between 2014 and 2016.
Under the pen name Selena Montgomery, Abrams is the award-winning author of eight romantic suspense novels, which have sold more than 100,000 copies. As co-founder of NOW Account, a financial services firm that helps small businesses grow, Abrams has helped create and retain jobs in Georgia. And through her various business ventures, she has helped employ even more Georgians, including hundreds of young people starting out. As House Minority Leader, she has worked strategically to recruit, train, elect and defend Democrats to prevent a Republican supermajority in the House, and she has worked across the aisle on behalf of all Georgians. During her tenure, she has stopped legislation to raise taxes on the poor and middle class and to roll back reproductive healthcare. She has brokered compromises that led to progress on transportation, infrastructure, and education. In the legislature, she passed legislation to improve the welfare of grandparents and other kin raising children and secured increased funding to support these families.
Abrams and her five siblings grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi with three tenets: go to school, go to church, and take care of each other. Despite struggling to make ends meet for their family, her parents made service a way of life for their children -- if someone was less fortunate, it was their job to serve that person. This ethic led the family to Georgia. Abrams's parents attended Emory University to pursue graduate studies in divinity and become United Methodist ministers. Abrams and her younger siblings attended DeKalb County Schools, and she graduated from Avondale High School.

Galit Ariel is a transdisciplinary creative and strategic thinker. She defines herself as a "digital hippie" since she's passionate about a future that will integrate technology into our everyday lives but not control it. Her book Augmenting Alice: The Future of Identity, Experience and Reality explores the manner in which augmented reality's application will shift cultural and functional paradigms and redefine core concepts related to culture, space, experience and ethics.
Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II is president of Repairers of the Breach, national co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign and the leader of Moral Monday, an alliance of more than 200 progressive organizations.
As the architect of the Moral Monday, the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II stands for a multi-racial, multi-faith movement fighting for voting rights, public education, universal health care, environmental protection as well as the rights of women, labor, immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community. In 2013, thousands joined weekly protests at the North Carolina state legislature; more than a thousand were arrested in civil disobedience. Monday coalition continues to draw tens of thousands each year.
For the past two years, Dr. Barber has led a national organizing tour called The Revival: Time for a Moral Revolution of Values, working alongside Rev. Dr. James Forbes, Rev. Dr. Traci Blackmon and Sister Simone Campbell to redefine public morality and support state coalitions to address poverty, injustice and inequality. Rev. Dr. Barber headed the state NAACP from 2006 to 2017 and serves on the NAACP National Board of Directors. With Rev. Dr. Elizabeth Theoharis, he co-chairs the Poor People's Campaign, A National Call For A Moral Revival, which focuses on systemic racism, poverty and inequality, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism, and national morality. Rev. Dr. Barber is visiting professor of public theology and activism at Union Theological Seminary and the author of Forward Together: A Moral Vision for the Nation and The Third Reconstruction. He is a member of the College of Affirming Bishops and lives in Goldsboro, NC, where he has pastored Greenleaf Christian Church for 25 years.
Deeply influenced by the social inequalities around her and inspired by her father's social work in her early years, Shad Begum has become a nationally and internationally known figure because of her determined struggle to improve the conditions of the marginalized segments, especially women, of her community in the northwest of Pakistan -- a deeply religious and conservative area where Taliban publicly execute men and women for nonconformity to their version of Islam. Begum is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit Association for Behaviour & Knowledge Transformation (ABKT), an organization working toward the economic and political empowerment of communities in underserved areas of Pakistan. Her organization was uprooted during the Taliban takeover in Swat due to massive displacement of people in 2009-2010. Against enormous odds, her resilience kept ABKT alive.
Begum previously worked with the UN Human Settlements Program as a consultant for the Building Gender Ladder Project as well as with UNDP's Women Political Participation Program. To encourage women at the grassroots level, she contested local elections in 2001 as an independent candidate and served as councilor for five years in Dir Lower. Begum is an Ashoka fellow, a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at National Endowment for Democracy and an Acumen Fellow. She won the US Department of State's International Woman of Courage Award in 2012.

Tarana Burke's passion for community organizing began in the late 1980s, when she joined a youth development organization called 21st Century and led campaigns around issues like racial discrimination, housing inequality and economic justice. Her career took a turn toward supporting survivors of sexual violence upon moving to Selma, Alabama, to work for 21st Century. She encountered dozens of black girls who were sharing stories of sexual violence and abuse, stories she identified with very well. She realized too many girls were suffering through abuse without access to resources, safe spaces and support, so in 2007 she created Justbe Inc., an organization committed to the empowerment and wellness of black girls. The impacts of Justbe Inc. are widespread, as the program, which was adopted by every public school in Selma, has hundreds of alumni who have gone on to thrive and succeed in various ways.
Burke's role as the senior director at Girls for Gender Equity in Brooklyn, NY, an intergenerational nonprofit dedicated to strengthening local communities by creating opportunities for young women and girls to live self-determined lives, is a continuation of what she considers her life's work. Since #MeToo, the movement she created more than ten years ago, became a viral hashtag, she has emerged as a global leader in the evolving conversation around sexual violence and the need for survivor-centered solutions. Her theory of using empathy to empower survivors is changing the way the nation and the world think about and engage with survivors. Her belief that healing isn't a destination but a journey has touched and inspired millions of survivors who previously lived with the pain, shame and trauma of their assaults in isolation.

Katharine Hayhoe studies what climate change means to us in the places where we live.
As Katharine Hayhoe writes: "I'm a climate scientist: I crunch the data, I analyze the models, and I help people like engineers and city managers and water planners prepare for the ways climate change affects all of us. I'm a professor in political science at Texas Tech University, where I direct the Climate Science Center. I'm also a lead author for the US National Climate Assessment; I host the PBS Digital Series Global Weirding; and I spend a lot of time talking to people about climate science, impacts, solutions and how they connect to our values. I've been named one of TIME's "100 Most Influential People," Fortune's "50 Greatest Leaders" and Foreign Policy's "100 Leading Global Thinkers."
"These are all tremendous honors, for which I'm enormously grateful. What means the most, though, is when just one person tells me sincerely that they had never cared about climate change before, or even thought it was real: but now, because of something they heard me say, they've changed their mind. That's what makes it all worthwhile."
Maeve Higgins started off as a standup comedian, but eventually started to write things down to help her make sense of the world.
Maeve Higgins is the host of the hit podcast Maeve in America: Immigration IRL. She has performed all over the world and is now based in New York, where she co-hosts Neil deGrasse Tyson's StarTalk on National Geographic and has appeared in Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer. Her new book is Maeve in America: Essays by a Girl from Somewhere Else.
As Higgins writes: "I am extremely curious and am constantly finding out things I didn't even know I didn't know. I get a kick out of making people laugh, but I also worry a lot, so my head is an odd place to be, but I like it. These days I follow my curiosity, so if I suddenly wonder why most of the nannies in my neighborhood are women of color, and most of the children they take care of are white, I make it my job to figure out how it got to be that way. I research and ask questions and write about that. People are surprised to hear that I ended up here after starting out as a comedian, but I know that for me, comedy was always a way to figure things out, and as I grew up, my questions just got a little more expansive. I moved to the US five years ago and being an immigrant has also opened my eyes to a lot."

As Lindy Lou Isonhood writes: "I was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, in December 1951 and was raised by my grandmother, a widow with nine children. She was my salvation. From her nurturing I acquired my integrity, independence and strength. She impacted the lives of all around her. I was employed for over half my life: as a federal police officer in the 1970s, then I went on to be the first female letter carrier with the US Postal Service in Jackson for seven years, followed by 18 years in the MS Army National Guard. I ended my working career as an office manager after 13 years with an architectural firm.
"A strong Christian, I am married to a retired colonel who is a very staunch conservative, like me. I'm the mother of two children, a son and a daughter, and three grandchildren -- all girls! The hearts of my life! There is nothing extraordinary about me. I have never achieved fame or any outstanding records or recognition. Never received a college degree although I have many accumulated hours. But my life reached a turning point when I served as a juror in the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial in 1994. This experience changed me from the inside out."

For their advocacy, the two were nominated for the National Courage in Journalism award and honored by the Women's Media Center. Madhira is a student leader of the New Voices movement in Texas and speaks about the importance of students’ and teachers’ rights across the country.
Helen Marriage cofounded a company that specializes in creating disruptive, whole-city arts events that surprise and delight everyone who comes across them.
Helen Marriage writes: "I am a producer of large-scale disruptive moments that place an artist's ideas in the heart of a city. I started life unsure of how to find a job and began helping a street theater company perform at the Edinburgh Festival. Only then did I realize that this could be a career. That was forty years ago. Since then, I've gone on to shut down central London and other cities with ephemeral events that transform people’s understanding of what a city is for and who controls it.
"I don't believe that cities are exclusively about shopping and traffic. Over the years I've developed a real sense of how artists can change the world, if only we make space for their vision. I guess that's my job -- to create a context in which the normal routines of daily life are disrupted for a moment to allow the public, especially those who know they’re not interested in anything the arts might have to say, to discover a new world we’d all like to live in."

I am the author of several academic publications and four books, each of them very different. From a street novel about prostitution to a statistical narrative about African Americans in the 21st century to a book about the criminalization of Black girls in schools, I try to meet people where they are on this journey toward freedom. My latest project, a dive into the pedagogical practices that make education freedom work, explores how schools might become locations of healing for Black and Brown girls. And I love Prince. Always have, always will."
Beth Mortimer is a scientific researcher interested in how animals use vibrations along surfaces and through materials for information.
As Beth Mortimer writes: "I believe that through studying nature we can gain useful insights for new technologies. I am pioneering this approach for an overlooked form of information transfer: vibrations that travel along surfaces and through materials. I study how animals use this information source, which is widespread from spiders and worms to humans and elephants. My research enables me to gain insights for potential new technologies, for example monitoring elephant behavior in remote locations or developing vibration sensors for robots to monitor dangerous machinery.
"I am a biologist by training and have collaborated across scientific disciplines throughout my research career. I have worked with engineers, material scientists, seismologists and computer scientists to learn cutting-edge techniques that I can use to study information transfer with animals. My goal for the next five to seven years is to develop usable technologies for remote monitoring, learning from the biological systems I study."

Driven by curiosity and appreciation for the complex, beautiful, diverse and dynamic world around us, Tarje Nissen-Meyer is trying to decipher this vibrating planet by analyzing data from human and biological interaction with our precious environment and modern technology.
As Tarje Nissen-Meyer writes: "Much like gazing at the sky, I wonder how our pristine planet functions. Where does hot magma come from, why can't we predict earthquakes, what is the link between climate and Earth, where does life come from and how does it end, and can we find extraterrestrial life? Society depends on the environment: how can we provide clean energy for ten billion people, deal with water scarcity, sea level rise, natural hazards? These are research themes in geophysics, and they require quantitative reasoning.
"In my own research, I develop methods for earthquake waves for free use, work on mapping Earth's interior, earthquake hazard, cyclones and elephant communication. I believe education and science play an ever larger role in extracting useful information from the ever-increasing amount of data to deliver critical decision-making skills and evaluating uncertainties, especially in times of fake news."

Emily Quinn describes herself as "a ballsy intersex activist who uses humor and storytelling to create a more welcoming world for people who don’t fit in a box."
At age 10, Emily Quinn learned she was intersex. As she writes: "Doctors said not to tell anyone, poking and prodding at me like I was a science experiment. It was lonely, shameful, and I had nowhere to turn. I needed someone to tell me that it would be OK, but no one was there.
"Fourteen years later, I discovered an intersex support group, meeting hundreds of intersex people who endured trauma like mine. I knew it had to stop. I was working at Cartoon Network and decided to help create the first intersex main character on television: Lauren on MTV's 'Faking It.' I publicly came out as intersex alongside her debut, and suddenly I was bombarded with interviews, appearing in content across the web. The impact was so great that I quit my job, created a YouTube channel, began speaking globally about intersex experiences, and am now writing a YA novel. In ways I could have never imagined, I became the person I needed as a kid -- showing myself that one day it would be OK."

The article was censored by her principal because he claimed Stack’s story was negative, used the word ‘banned’ instead of ‘removed’, and contained grammatical errors. (The errors were an extra period and a missing apostrophe.) This was one out of three articles that were censored at the paper leading to Stack, fellow student journalist Neha Madhira, and her staff speaking out with the help of the Student Press Law Center. Several news outlets covered their story, including NBC 5, The Dallas Morning News and The New York Times.
Stack continues to fight for student press rights through New Voices, a student-led legislative movement attempting to protect students from censorship and protect advisers from being pushed out. Stack hopes to continue her fight and further her journalistic education in college.
In her work, the Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis makes a theological case for ending poverty.
The Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis is an ordained minister with the Presbyterian Church, the director of the Kairos Center for Rights, Religions, and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary and the co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. She has spent the past two decades organizing amongst the poor and dispossessed in the United States.

In 2018, alongside the Reverend Dr. William J. Barber, Theoharis helped to launch the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. Over the coming years, the campaign will organize poor people across race, religion, geography, political party and other so-called lines of division to fuel a moral revolution of values in the country.
Amanda Williams blurs the distinction between art and architecture through works that employ color as a way to draw attention to the political complexities of race, place and value in cities.
The landscapes in which Amanda Williams operates are the visual residue of the invisible policies and forces that have misshapen most inner cities. Her installations, paintings, video and works on paper seek to inspire new ways of looking at the familiar -- and raise questions about the state of urban space in America in the process.
Williams has exhibited widely, including the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale, a solo exhibition at the MCA Chicago, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis. She is a 2018 United States Artists Fellow, a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors grantee, an Efroymson Family Arts Fellow, a Leadership Greater Chicago Fellow and a member of the multidisciplinary Museum Design team for the Obama Presidential Center. She is this year's Bill and Stephanie Sick Distinguished Visiting Professor at the School of the Art Institute Chicago and has previously served as a visiting assistant professor of architecture at Cornell University and Washington University in St. Louis. She lives and works on Chicago's south side.
Paula Stone Williams is a pastor, counselor, speaker, LGBTQ ambassador and gender equity advocate.
The Reverend Dr. Paula Stone Williams knows the truth will set you free, but only after it upends your carefully constructed narrative. Her devotion to authenticity caused her to leave her comfort zone as a nationally known religious leader and follow her heart to transition from Paul to Paula. She lost all of her jobs and most of her friends. Williams also discovered the massive differences between life as a male and as a female in America.
Williams is the pastor of preaching and worship at Left Hand Church in Longmont, Colorado, a pastoral counselor with RLT Pathways and a sought-after speaker to corporations, government agencies, universities and religious institutions on issues of gender equity and LGBTQ advocacy. She has been featured in the New York Times, the Denver Post, New Scientist, Radio New Zealand, Colorado Public Radio and The Huffington Post. Her TEDxMileHigh talk on gender equity has had more than one million views.
Jonathan Williams likes to tell stories and throw parties, so he started a church that allowed him to do both.
After teaching fifth grade in West Philadelphia for seven years, Jonathan Williams decided to join the family business and become a pastor like his father. He started a church in Brooklyn, NY, and just three months later faced a religious and personal reckoning when his father announced her transition from male to female. Williams decided that his church would become an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, forever shifting the landscape in his personal and professional life.
Williams continues to lead Forefront Church in Brooklyn. In January 2019, he released his book, She's My Dad: A Father’s Transition and a Son's Redemption, published by Westminster John Knox Press. Williams has told his story to the New York Times, Huffington Post, Christian Standard Magazine, Faithfully Magazine and Rebel Storytellers.
Marian Wright Edelman fights for a level playing field for all children, so their chances to succeed don't have to depend on the lottery of birth.
Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president emerita of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF), has been an advocate for disadvantaged Americans for her entire professional life. Under her leadership, CDF has become the nation's strongest voice for children and families. The CDF's "Leave No Child Behind" mission is "to ensure every child a Healthy Start, a Head Start, a Fair Start, a Safe Start, and a Moral Start in life and successful passage to adulthood with the help of caring families and communities."
Edelman, a graduate of Spelman College and Yale Law School, began her career in the mid-'60s when, as the first black woman admitted to the Mississippi Bar, she directed the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund office in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1968, she moved to Washington, DC as counsel for the Poor People's Campaign that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. began organizing before his death. She founded the Washington Research Project, a public interest law firm and the parent body of the CDF. For two years she served as the director of the Center for Law and Education at Harvard University and in 1973 began CDF. Edelman served on the Board of Trustees of Spelman College, which she chaired from 1976 to 1987, and was the first woman elected by alumni as a member of the Yale University Corporation, on which she served from 1971 to 1977. She has received more than 100 honorary degrees and many awards, including the Albert Schweitzer Humanitarian Prize, the Heinz Award, a MacArthur Foundation Prize Fellowship, the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- the nation's highest civilian award -- and the Robert F. Kennedy Lifetime Achievement Award for her writings.

Text: Lent is a precious time of retreat for Catholics across the world. We know that Lent is a time of renewal in faith, hope and love so that we can enter more fully into the celebration of the Sacred Triduum of Jesus’ last supper, his suffering and death on the cross, and his glorious resurrection. As a PK-12 College community, our recognition of Shrove Tuesday, and the commencement of our Lenten journey on Ash Wednesday with liturgies across our three campuses invited each of us to walk with one another during this time of renewal and refocus.
Year 10 students sold pancakes on both the Marcellin and Lavalla Campuses on Shrove Tuesday (5 March) in support of Project Compassion. Students at the Marian campus also received pancakes, with the Kindy and Pre Primary students making theirs with the help of their teachers. A total of $816.85 was raised across the three campuses.
Students were invited to participate in the Caritas Fast held on Wednesday 13 March. Over 150 students participated in the Fast which saw them forgo their usual meals throughout the school day. The students were given barley sugars at recess and a handful of cold, cooked rice at lunch and a muffin at the end of the day. This small amount of food aimed at helping students appreciate how little some people in our world have to eat. It was a fantastic day which helped raise $3630.95 for Project Compassion.
On Tuesday 12 March, students on the Marian Campus took part in the Walk for Water initiative to help them understand how some children around the world walk for many kilometres just to get water each day. Students watched the story of Thandolwayo from Vietnam who risks her life each day just to bring water back for her family? Click here to hear her story.
This is the third year that this important whole-of-College annual event has been celebrated. The evening gave families and staff the opportunity to come together as an intentional Catholic-Marist community, and to share the Eucharist together as we begin this year as a united community. The evening was also an opportunity for the College to commission the Year 6 and Year 12 student leaders for 2019.
The Newman College Ministry Plan seeks to invite all students into an experience of prayer and ongoing Christian discipleship. Across Years 3–10, all students are afforded an opportunity to experience an annual retreat day. The Year 10 Damascus Day, run by the Perth-based Youth Mission Team, was an opportunity provided to all students in Year 10 to stop, withdraw and reflect on the opportunities and abundance they are called into on their own personal journey, and the collective journey of the cohort.
During this important time of quiet reflection and time away from the usual school routines whilst on Retreat, the Year 12 students had an opportunity to seriously reflect upon their lives. Several aspects of personal growth and awareness were considered such as self-esteem, relationships and responsibilities, as well as developing a broader sense of community. While on Retreat students had opportunities to explore and deepen their spirituality and faith experiences through small group sharing, reflective prayer and celebrating the Eucharist.
“This retreat has been a valuable experience to me as you get to hang out more with people you didn’t realise you would get along with so much, while still having the time to be with your mates too”.
“I came to Year 12 Retreat with the intention of just relaxing for a few days and to get away from schoolwork, but I ended up being able to really open up and get so much more out of it than I expected”.
“Year 12 Retreat encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and get a richer understanding of my year group, it was an amazing experience”.
On Saturday 24 November, 16 Year 11 students and 3 accompanying staff members embarked on the 2018 Year 11 Philippines Immersion. The Philippines Immersion is another practical way in which our Marist communities at Newman College and sister school St Joseph’s School seek to build opportunities for solidarity, community engagement, relationships and connections between Western Australia and the Philippines. Since returning, these students have presented their experience of the Immersion to the PK-12 Newman College staff, and at the first Principal’s Assembly.

Please click here to view and listen to an original poem, prepared by the students, with accompanying images to reflect on the experiences of the immersion.
As the year continues, our students will have a range of advocacy opportunities to promote justice and share their insights to grow a wider awareness among our College community.
All parents, guardians and families across our PK-12 College are invited to attend the weekly Thursday morning Mass celebrated by Fr Mark Baumgarten. Our weekly Newman College Community Mass is an important way that we as a Catholic community seek to nourish and live-out our faith in community with one another.
